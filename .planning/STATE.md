# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-23)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Fastify 5 over Express: first-class TypeScript, serves static dashboard build
- Service account (not OAuth2) for Google Calendar: avoids 7-day token expiry in Testing mode
- chrono-node pre-filter before Gemini: eliminates 80-90% of Gemini calls on group messages
- CLI imports Drizzle directly (no HTTP): same DB layer, no Fastify dependency
- node-cron inside process (not PM2 cron_restart): PM2 restart kills WhatsApp session

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 8]: GCP service account setup must happen at Phase 8 start — do not defer to end of phase
- [Phase 8]: SQLite WAL mode + busy_timeout must be set on ALL DB connections before Phase 8 writes group messages concurrently
- [Phase 8]: Baileys 7.0.0-rc.9 `key.fromMe` behavior in group context needs validation via debug log during early Phase 8 development
- Baileys v7.0.0-rc.9 is a release candidate — monitor stability in production
